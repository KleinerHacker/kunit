# kunit Changelog

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Core mixed-unit engine (`KUnitInstance`, `KUnitTerm`) supporting arbitrary combinations of units and
  exponents, with `+`, `-`, `*`, `/` operators and a `hasSameUnits` check for unit/exponent equality.
- Full SI prefix support (`KUnitPrefix`, Quetta/Q to Quecto/q) usable with any unit via generic `infix`
  construction, e.g. `5 kilo meters`.
- Support for special/derived units per unit group and exponent (`KDerivedUnit`, `KScaledDerivedUnit`), e.g.
  hectare for area or liter for volume.
- New unit group **Length** (`org.pcsoft.framework.kunit.length`):
  - Units: meter, mile, nautical mile, yard, foot, inch, fathom, chain, furlong, astronomical unit,
    light-year, parsec.
  - Multi-dimensional support for area (exponent 2) and volume (exponent 3), including the special units
    are, hectare, acre (area) and liter, US gallon, imperial gallon, US fluid ounce, oil barrel (volume).
  - Full operator (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`) and comparison (`==`, `!=`, `<`, `<=`, `>`, `>=`) support, with
    automatic conversion between length units and `toString`/`valueIn` output in any target unit.
- Creation of units and mixed units from any `Number` type (`Int`, `Long`, `Float`, `Double`, ...), always
  normalized to `Double` internally.
