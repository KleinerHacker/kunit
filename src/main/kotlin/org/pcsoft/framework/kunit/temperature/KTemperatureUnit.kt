/**
 * The units of the **temperature** group with base unit [KELVIN] ([baseValue] `1.0`).
 *
 * Temperature is the framework's **first and (by decision) permanent affine exception**: unlike every
 * other group, converting between temperature units is not a single multiplicative factor but an
 * offset-and-scale (affine) transform - `25 °C` is not `25 × 1 °C`. The multiplicative engine
 * ([baseValue], `N of unit` = `scaledBy`) therefore cannot express these conversions on its own.
 *
 * To keep the shared engine unchanged (no breaking change), each unit additionally carries the two
 * lambdas [toBase] (reading value → absolute kelvin) and [fromBase] (absolute kelvin → reading value).
 * Values are stored internally as **absolute kelvin** (a single `KELVIN^1` term), so `*`/`/`/`pow` keep
 * running linearly through the generic engine; only construction and reading go through the affine
 * lambdas (see `KTemperatureUnitInstance`).
 *
 * The group deliberately offers **no prefixes** (explicit exclusion, permitted by `architecture-prefix.md`).
 *
 * Conversions:
 * - `°C = K − 273.15`
 * - `°F = (K − 273.15) · 9/5 + 32`
 *
 * Example:
 * ```kotlin
 * (0 of celsius) into kelvin        // 273.15
 * (100 of celsius) into fahrenheit  // 212.0
 * (32 of fahrenheit) into celsius   // 0.0
 * ```
